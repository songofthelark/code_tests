    well_id		int,
    well_time	timestamp,
    y			double precision[]
);

select well_id from accelerometers where average(y) < -0.5 and datediff('h', current_timestamp, well_time) = 12

I don't have a postgres instance here but I assume an average of an array would return the average of the values in the array.  I can't find a clear answer in the docs saying so but maybe too obvious. Mysql doesn't have an array type.
